# The Terminal or The Command Line Interface (cli) vs File Directory

#### Command Line Best Practices for using *~cd* change directory command: 

###### Remember space and capitalization is important; they effect your commands.

> - *Use tab for auto-complete if you are prone to typos; type first letter of file then tab*

> - *Use periods or "dots" to navigate backwards to previous folder in terminal.

> - One period means where you are and two periods means back one level. Three periods means back two levels. 

>> ### *~cd ...* 

>>> *Back two level*

### Commands in Terminal ~ : 

*pwd* to see where you are; *ls* to see files where you are; and *cd* to change directories. 

- *~clear* Clears terminal screen

- *~pwd* "Print working directory": *~pwd* shows us where we are in file directory. (users/lewisables/CODE FELLOWS)

- *~ls* "List" *~ls* shows list of directories (files) where you are currently at in file directory applications CODEFELLOWS Documents etc..

- *~cd* "Change Directory" This how you move around in the terminal screen. *~cd*  takes you to your home directory. *~cd* space "then name of folder";  is how you navigate using your terminal.

- *~mkdir* Command to make a directory *~mkdir* *space* "name of directory"

### Arguments:

- *~ls* Arguments: We can use arguments with commands in the Terminal to make the command behave differently.

- *~ls* Arguments

- *~ls -l* commands list to display as a list with more detail about each file.

- *~ls -a* commands list to show all hidden files. Your configuration files.

# Text Editor vs Coding-Specific Text Editor vs IDE (Integrated Developement Environment)

## NOTES

### Text Editor

- *A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site.*

- *The most important features are: 1.) code completion; 2.) syntax highlighting; 3.) a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue); and 4.) the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them. You might find some other features that are must-have’s, but I think these features are a good start.
A great feature of any text editing software is code completion. Code completion allows you to start typing, and the code completion feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally typed.*
