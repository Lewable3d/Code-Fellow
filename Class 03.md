# git 

- git is a version control system
- git lets multiple developers work on the same code
- git keeps a history of changes to your files
- git gives the ability to view, apply, and remove those files
- keep all of your project files in one repository
- each repository is a project

### Sharing Code and Collaboration: dvcs *"distributed visual control system"* for the masses

## Snapshots in time

*git takes snapshots of your project over time*

- Commits represent each successive version of a file or files.
- Commits are the equivalent of *"Save As"*
- Each successive version creates a new snapshot on the timeline of the project.
- Git keeps track of what the file looked like at different points in time.

## Keeping Track

- Each commit (snapshot) has a label that points to it
- HEAD = The label meaning "You Are Here"
- You can also assign messages to commits
- Messages are like writing a caption for your snapshot.

## Git Summary

- You Git to take snapshots of your code at points in time
- Git keeps a history of what those snapshots look like
- Git has a special label called *Head*, that means *"You Are Hare"*
- Usually you will want to give your snapshot a label called a message to give detail of your changes.

## GitHub: *Your Code in Cloud*
