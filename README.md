### Hello Everyone!

I am very excited about my new journey in computer science. I joined _Code Fellows_ to extend my computer skills and knowledge. 
I am currently in retail sales of automotive parts and tools. I earned an Associates degree in Accounting from _Oklahoma State University_, a Computer-Aided Architectural Drafting certificate and Automotive Technology certificate From _Metro Technology Centers_ and I also started my own music production company; _Infinite/80 Productions,LLC_. I plan to pair my new aquiring computer science knowledge with my other degrees and certificates to better my life and business.
