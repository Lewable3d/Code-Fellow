# The Terminal or The Command Line Interface (cli) vs File Directory

### Commands in Terminal: 

- *~pwd* (Print working directory): Command *~pwd* shows us where we are in file directory. (users/lewisables/CODE FELLOWS)

- *~ls* (List) Command: *~ls* shows list of directories (files) where you are currently at in file directory: Applications CODEFELLOWS Documents etc..

- *~ls* Arguments: We can use arguments with the *~ls* command to make the command behave differently.

- *~ls* Arguments

- *~ls -l* commands list to display as a list with more detail about each file.

# Text Editor vs Coding-Specific Text Editor vs IDE (Integrated Developement Environment)

## NOTES

### Text Editor

- *A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site.*

- *The most important features are: 1.) code completion; 2.) syntax highlighting; 3.) a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue); and 4.) the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them. You might find some other features that are must-haveâ€™s, but I think these features are a good start.
A great feature of any text editing software is code completion. Code completion allows you to start typing, and the code completion feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally typed.*
