## Snapshots in time

*git takes snapshots of your project over time*

- Commits represent each successive version of a file or files.
- Commits are the equivalent of *"Save As"*
- Each successive version creates a new snapshot on the timeline of the project.
- Git keeps track of what the file looked like at different points in time.

- HEAD = The label meaning "You Are Here"
- You can also assign messages to commits
- Messages are like writing a caption for your snapshot.
