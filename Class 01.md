## Heading Best Practices

# Remeber

* Markdown applications don’t agree on how to handle a missing space between the number signs (#) and the heading name. For compatibility, 
always put a space between the number signs and the heading name.

# Bold

* To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.

- I just love **bold text**.

> Markdown: I just love ** bold text **.

- I just love __bold text__.

> Markdown: I just love __ bold text __.

- Love**is**bold 

> Markdown: Love ** is ** bold

# HyperLinks

- Enclose URL in parentheses (URL)

>or the use of HTML tags. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plain text documents.
>Markdown is used to make static sites easier using open source tools. Markdown is platform independent. Markdown is future proof. Even if the application 
>you’re using stops working at some point in the future, you’ll still be able to read your Markdown-formatted text using a text editing application. 
>Markdown is portable. Markdown can be used for everything. People use it to create websites.

- ### Heading 

>The number of Hashtags you use determines the heading level. 
>Markdown applications don’t agree on how to handle underscores in the middle of a word. For compatibility, use asterisks to bold and italicize the middle >of a word for emphasis.

- ### Links

>To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses 
>To create an unordered list, add dashes (-), asterisks (*), or plus signs (+) in front of line items. Indent one or more items to create a nested list.

### Images

>To add an image, add an exclamation mark (!), followed by alt text in brackets, and the path or URL to the image asset in parentheses. You can optionally >
