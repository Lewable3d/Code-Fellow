Markdown is an easy way to markup language to use to formatt plain text. For example, You can use # to set heading size.

# heading1

## heading2

Markdown applications don’t agree on how to handle a missing space between the number signs (#) and the heading name. For compatibility, 
always put a space between the number signs and the heading name.
Paragraphs

To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.

Ordered Lists
To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods. The numbers don’t have to be in numerical order, but the list should 
start with the number one.

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
    1. Indented item
    2. Indented item
4. Fourth item

Ordered List Best Practices
CommonMark and a few other lightweight markup languages let you use a parenthesis ()) as a delimiter (e.g., 1) First item), 
but not all Markdown applications support this, so it isn’t a great option from a compatibility perspective. For compatibility, use periods only.

Unordered Lists
To create an unordered list, add dashes (-), asterisks (*), or plus signs (+) in front of line items. Indent one or more items to create a nested list.

- First item            
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item

* First item
* Second item
* Third item
* Fourth item

- First item
- Second item
- Third item
    - Indented item
    - Indented item
- Fourth item

Unordered List Best Practices
Markdown applications don’t agree on how to handle different delimiters in the same list. For compatibility, don’t mix and match delimiters in the same list — pick one and stick with it.

Blockquotes
* This is the first list item.
* Here's the second list item.

    > A blockquote would look great below the second list item.

* And here's the third list item.
The rendered output looks like this:

1. Open the file containing the Linux mascot.
2. Marvel at its beauty.
